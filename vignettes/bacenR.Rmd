The {bacenR} package provides tools to download and process data from the Central Bank of Brazil (Banco Central do Brasil — Bacen) in a simple and efficient way. Currently, the package includes the following functions:

- `get_balance_sheets()`: download balance sheets from financial institutions
- `tidy_balance_sheets()`: process downloaded balance sheets and combine them into a single, unified file
- `get_normative_data()`: download regulatory metadata
- `get_normative_txt()`: download the full texts of regulatory instructions

Additional functions and features will be added in future releases.
